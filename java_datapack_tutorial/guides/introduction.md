## What are datapacks
Datapacks, in their most basic form, are folders (or zip files) with a valid `pack.mcmeta` inside of it. Datapacks do not modify the code in any way. 
Datapacks can contain:
- advancements
- dimensions
- functions
- loot tables
- predicates
- recipes
- structures
- tags
- world generation settings

The main focus of this course will be on functions, but advancements, loot tables, predicates, recipes, structures, and tags will be covered. 
Dimensions and world generation will not be covered in this course.
